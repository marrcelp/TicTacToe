Welcome to my app - classic Tic-tac-toe gome, where two players take turns placing circles and crosses on a grid of nine squares, aiming to form three of their symbols in a row to win. This game requires strategic thinking and planning, while also being easy and quick to play.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
